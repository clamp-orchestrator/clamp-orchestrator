Welcome to the contribution guide. We are excited that you have decided to take a plunge and support Clamp ecosystem by contributing. There is always a good backlog of features that we are trying incorporate in Clamp. We appreciate all the help we can get to improve the tool in terms of features, code quality, documentation, supporting toolchain, testing and demos/examples. To make it as easy as possible to contribute and keep the experience consistent there are several things to keep in mind. This document will address those aspects to ensure that submitting improvements and contributing is a seamless experience.

## Code of conduct

Clamp project aspires to build a community that is respectful, inclusive and kind. We have adopted [Contributor Covenant's](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) code of conduct for open source project. The code of conduct is documented and availble [here](code-of-conduct.md).

## Contributing
